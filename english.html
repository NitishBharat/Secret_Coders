            <h2 class="heading">ELECTRIC FENCE CONTROL</h2>
            <p class="para">The electric fence is used to control animals and livestock. There are two types of controllers: One type delivers a continuous controlled AC current of about 5 mA. The other delivers a capacitive discharge, like the working principle of a defibrillator. The repetitive frequency is around 1 Hz, and the capacitor is charged to a DC voltage up to 10 kV. The large voltage secures that the shock will pass the animal’s hair-covered skin. The shock is similar to an electrostatic discharge, even if the electric fence shock energy is higher and the duration longer. The capacitor is charged to energy typically in the range 0.25–10 J.

            <h2 class="heading">CROP SUGGESTION</h2>
            <p class = "para">In order to mitigate the agrarian crisis in the current status quo, there is a need for better recommendation systems to alleviate the crisis by helping the farmers to make an informed decision before starting the cultivation of crops. <br> <br> There are several existing models for crop prediction about which farmers are unaware, may be due to its complexity or cost-effectiveness. Hence there is a need of developing such a model that is simple, user-friendly, and cost-effective and reach desired accuracy. All the existing methods are only region (location) based but, in our algorithm, region is embedded with season so that the accuracy of the prediction can be improved. Here crop yield forecast models are prepared based on crop weather studies for estimating yield much before actual harvest of the crops.

            <p>What is in it for you <br><br>   Soil Health Card Scheme is a scheme launched by the Government of India on 19 February 2015. Under the scheme, the government plans to issue soil cards to farmers which will carry crop-wise recommendations of nutrients and fertilisers required for the individual farms to help farmers to improve productivity through judicious use of inputs. All soil samples are to be tested in various soil testing labs across the country. Thereafter the experts will analyse the strength and weaknesses (micro-nutrients deficiency) of the soil and suggest measures to deal with it. The result and suggestion will be displayed in the cards.

            <h2 class="heading">TEMRATURE AND HUMADITY
            </h2>
            <p class = "para">Plants need four things to survive: light, water, soil and air. However, to raise healthy plants, the most important element is the effect of water. Water is crucial in regard to relative humidity.   
                Relative humidity is a measure of how much water the air can hold at any given temperature. This means that say the air is at 60% humidity at 20 degrees, then the air is at 60% of its total moisture capacity for that temperature.
            </p>
            <h4 class = "subhead">How can high humidity and temperature affect agriculture?</h4>
            <p class = "para">Imbalances in humidity can affect this process. For example, if humidity levels are too high then there’s nowhere for the evaporating water from the stomata to go, the air is already saturated. <br> <br>
                This means that, despite having the stomata constantly open, the plant fails to respire and can essentially drown in a soup of trapped CO2 and water. The plant failing altogether is obviously the worst-case scenario here but at best this will still result in stunted growth in the plant due to an inability to conduct its everyday processes. <br> <br>
                Additionally, crops are more susceptible to a variety of diseases, fungus and parasites that thrive in humid conditions. <br> <br>
                High temperature has similar effects in terms of influencing the stomata, though it can have the opposite effect. <br> <br>
                At high temperatures, with low relative humidity, plants tend to close their stomata in order to preserve water. However, warm air is more capable of holding larger volumes of moisture, meaning that the combination of high relative humidity and high temperature can be lethal.</p>
            <h4 class = "subhead">How can low humidity and temperature affect agriculture?</h4>
            <p class = "para">Once again, low humidity affects those all-important stomata. Air with low levels of relative humidity can cause plants to close their stomata, in an attempt to conserve water, much like the effects of high temperature. <br> <br>
                In tandem with this is the effect of cold air, which is less capable of retaining moisture. Cold temperatures also cause many plants to stunt their growth as a self-protection mechanism, much like the effects of winter when most plants lose their leaves and lie dormant. <br> <br>
                Imbalances in either temperature or humidity can have a roster of detrimental effects upon plants and potentially cause whole crops to be wasted.

                <li>
            <h4 class = "subhead" >Soil Fertility
            </h4></li>
            <p class = "para">Approximately 90% of the soils sampled in Ireland are lacking in either phosphorus (P), potassium (K) or lime, limiting their production potential.
                Low soil fertility equates to a loss of more than 2.0t grass DM/ha/year, which is worth €275/ha/year. <br> <br>
                Better soil fertility will support increased production, improve farm income and enhance environmental performance on the farm. <br> <br>
                Correcting soil fertility can allow growth for 25% more grass. Fertiliser losses can contribute to your farm’s greenhouse gas emissions and impact on water and air quality. <br><br>
                Improving soil fertility through nutrient management can also have environmental benefits. If nutrients are applied where they are most needed on the farm, they will be more readily absorbed by the soil preventing losses to the air and water. <br> <br>
                A tailored nutrient management plan & improving soil fertility can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration in soils.
                </p>
                <li>
            <h4 class = "subhead" >Soil Testing Guidance
            </h4></li>
            <p class = "para">If you don’t know what nutrients are in your soil, you can’t know how much extra nutrients it may need. <br><br>
                Soil should be tested every 3-5 years to measure soil fertility levels.
                Soil samples should be taken between October and February and prior to fertiliser application (waiting 3 months after the last application of P or K before sampling). <br> <br>
                Soil tests are relatively cheap (€25/sample) yet decisions on fertilizer (€300-€500/tonne) can be made without knowledge of soil nutrient levels. To spread costs, soil test a portion of the farm e.g. a quarter every year. <br><br>
                Repeating soil analysis over time (3-5 years) is critical to monitor the effectiveness of the farm fertiliser strategy. New soil test results should be compared with past results to assess changes in soil fertility over time.
                <br><br> Soil testing can save you money by identifying what areas of land have low soil fertility and need extra fertilizer to improve productivity. <br><br>
                Soil testing allows your fertiliser programme to be tailored to the specific needs of the soil and grass growth.
                 <br><br>
                 Soil testing at €25/sample is money well spent. By getting the P, K and lime levels correct you can produce €300 worth of additional grass/ha each year.
                </p>
            <li><h4 class = "subhead" >Soil pH & Limiting
            </h4></li>
            <p class = "para">The pH status of a soil plays an important role in grass production as nutrients only becomeavailable to grass at certain pH levels. <br><br>
                Soil pH correction through liming is the first step of soil fertility improvement on the farm as it increases the availability and efficiency of the applied fertiliser and organic manures. Money spent on lime is one of the best investments a farmer can make. <br><br>
                Spreading lime to improve soil pH generates better grass growth. </p>
 <h4>A sub-optimal pH level costs money in wasted fertiliser.</h4> <ul> <li>
Lime is most effective when it is applied in late autumn/early spring. This will encourage grass growth in spring time.</li>
<li>Apply lime in line with the advice given as per your soil test report.</li>
<li>Aim to have the whole farm at pH 6.3 for grass-only swards and pH 6.8 for grass-clover swards.</li>
<li>Lime should only be applied on silage fields in the autumn or 3 months before the silage is cut.</li>
<li>Leave up to 3 months between applying lime and following with urea/slurry application.</li><li> Alternatively apply urea/slurry first and after 10 days apply lime as recommended.</li><li>
If reseeding, any lime recommended should be applied and tilled into the seedbed before sowing commences.
</ul>
           <li> <h4 class = "subhead" >Soil Nutrients</h4></li>
           <p class = "para">If you don’t know about your soil fertility, spreading fertiliser may be wasteful and costing you money. <br><br>
            Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important nutrients for plant growth and crop production, however, when applied on soil with low soil fertility (pH, P or K), the recovery of nitrogen fertiliser inputs by grass or crops can be diminished. <br><br>
            Phosphorus (P) is important for crop establishment and root development and it also plays an important role in the nutrition of livestock. Phosphorus is central to plant energy and driving fast and efficient grass growthPhosphorous is very important in reseeded fields to achieve good grass establishment. <br><br>
            Potassium (K) increases stem strength, improves drought resistance, cold tolerance and increases yield. Potassium is very important in silage fields. <br><br>
            Sulphur (S) is an important nutrient for grassland, and is closely associated with N uptake and efficiency, helping to maintain crude protein.
